Sample Typescript + Python + Docker project

This is a sample project i used to learn creating full stack web applications with the stack: typescript (Next.js), python( flask framework) and Docker 

i discovered this project below on dev.to - https://dev.to/francescoxx/python-fullstack-rest-api-app-with-docker-1101, i ran into some errors following the instructions but i fixed them along the way


Architecture
simple schema explaining the app's architecture.

Flask, Python + TypeScript full stack web app, with next.js

- The frontend is a Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- The backend is written in Python, using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
- The database is PostgreSQL. We will use Docker to run the database, the backend, and also the frontend (you can also use Vercel). 

Docker Compose used to run the frontend, the backend, and the database together.
