Flask, Python + TypeScript full stack web app, with next

- The frontend is a Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- The backend is written in Python, using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
- The database is PostgreSQL. We will use Docker to run the database, the backend, and also the frontend (you can also use Vercel). We will use Docker Compose to run the frontend, the backend, and the database together.
